                  CBET has alternative options with Tuition Finance Company
                  (TFC), including no-interest financing for students who

                <Card.Text>
                  Students who receive loans to pay for their course of
                  instruction are responsible for repaying the full amount of
                  the loan, less the amount of any refund. Defaulting on loans
                  could result in damage to credit ratings, loss of eligibility
                  for future options, withholding of state and federal income
                  tax refunds, initiation of court action, and garnishment of
                  wages. CBET will transfer defaulted loans to collection
                  agencies. Credit may be adversely affected.
